# Automating collections assessment

This repository contains programs designed to automate the work of evaluating library electronic journal collections. The programs take advantage of the Scopus API to retreive citation data, and query library's link resolver systems using Open URL protocol.

This project will contain three programs that:
* identify which journals researchers publish in, and if the library collects them
* identify which journals researchers reference in their publications, and if the library collects them
* idenify which journals in a journal ranking list the library collects

Logic:
create a temp list of all coverage dates
for statement in list:
    determine what type of statement it is
    if current to present:
        extract start year (after word 'from')
        append start year, and word "present" to temp list
    if embargo:
        extract current year (after word 'from'), extract most recent year/month (after word 'recent')
        append start year, and most recent year/month to temp list
    if no current:
        extract current year (after word 'from'), extract end year (after word 'until')
        append start year, and end year to temp list

Compare all of the temp years in the list against each other and determine what the overall coverage is:
    oldest start date, most recent end date (to present >embargo > end)
Return a pd.Series column with the consolidated coverage dates

**** But what if there is a gap between coverage ranges?? e.g., 2001-2005, 2010 - present
